- 👋 Hi, I’m Ishan, a 20 Year Old Engineering Student from India.
- 👀 I’m a budding software developer, I've been working as a marketer for quite some time, now, I wish to take on the mantel of the builder with code.
- 🌱 It's 11th Oct 2021 and I've started the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Today is Day 1. I'll be learning Full Stack Development from scratch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building web apps. I really enjoy building products and seeing people use them.
- 📫 You can reach out to me on twitter @ishanshsh
